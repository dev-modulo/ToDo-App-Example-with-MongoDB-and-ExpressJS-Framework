# ToDo App Example with MongoDB and ExpressJS Framework

This Node.js application demonstrates a feature-rich web application with MongoDB as the database. The app incorporates various technologies and features for building a modern web application.





## Features

1. **Database with Mongoose (NoSQL)**:
   - Mongoose is used to define and interact with MongoDB database structures, providing a NoSQL approach to data management.

2. **Authentication with PassportJS**:
   - User authentication is implemented using PassportJS, ensuring secure login functionality with encrypted passwords stored in the database.

3. **Authorization**:
   - The application defines different levels of authorization to control access to specific features or resources based on user roles.

4. **MVC Design Pattern**:
   - The app follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern for a structured and maintainable codebase.

5. **Responsive UI Design**:
   - The user interface is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices for optimal user experience.

6. **Ajax for User Search**:
   - Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is utilized to enable real-time user search functionality without reloading the page.

7. **Flash Messages**:
   - Flash messages are used to provide feedback to users, such as success messages upon actions like login or form submission.
